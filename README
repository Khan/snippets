This directory holds code related to weekly snippets at the Khan Academy.

Here is the functionality involved:

1) Reading snippets that are mailed to a particular email account,
extracting the snippet-content and sender from the email, and storing
them in a database.

2) Once a week, collecting the week's snippets from the database and
sending them to interested users.

3) TODO(csilvers): A way of registering interest in snippets (perhaps
only from certain people?)  For now, all snippets are always sent to
'all'.  Best if it supports regexps.
